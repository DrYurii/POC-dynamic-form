# Dynamic Form System

This project is a **dynamic form management system** that allows form fields to be customized based on the user's country. It ensures compliance with local regulations by hiding, requiring, or allowing certain fields dynamically.

## Features

- Dynamically renders form fields based on country-specific rules
- Supports required and optional fields per country
- Stores form submissions with country of submission
- Provides a REST API for frontend-backend communication
- Implements ZOD validation after receiving user input
